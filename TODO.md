1. Where do I get the list of subreddits from?

2. Where do I store all my requests?

3. How does the backend communicate to the front-end that there's new data?

4. Better subreddit fetching. Instead of fetching all subreddits every hour, have an individual schedule for each subreddit. Schedule can be influenced by the popularity of the subreddit.
