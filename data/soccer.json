Crossbar is a real bonus! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

How could a team of professional footballers who are paid outrageous salaries and spend so much time training just for those 90 minutes on the pitch appear to be giving such a low effort performance? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically what I&amp;#39;m asking is do footballers actually give lazy performances where they aren&amp;#39;t trying as hard as they could or is that just our perception of a poor performance? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Spurs beat us because they had a pitch perfect game plan and pressed us and got balls over the wingbacks and did everything right. After last season&amp;#39;s EMBARRASSING team performance v Everton at Goodison, we need to make up for that. It&amp;#39;s impossible to EXPECT to make it to the Semi Final or Final itself because the competition is very tough, but as long as we don&amp;#39;t bottle it to Wolverhampton tomorrow or have a repeat of Burnley where we seriously failed to break down a defence, I&amp;#39;ll accept whatever result.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

On their current budget they should expect, in the next two years, to make the 1/4 finals in Europe, maybe. A good young team and a bit of luck, a deeper run and a close-run league finish.

Could start for Liverpool maybe?\n\nBellerin - Not there yet, but will be a starter for a top club for the next decade, could start for Citeh or Chelsea (Hector as a wingback in a 3-5-2 is something i want to see for us, but Wenger's not gonna play 3 at the back)\n\nCoq - Having a shit season, been decent in the past, probably not top team quality, wouldn't start for any of our rivals\n\nXhaka - Waste of money, been average at best in most games, has a mistake in him. Maybe he matures over time, not holding my breath, currently not a top player, would maybe start for Liverpool, not guaranteed though\n\nIwobi - Great prospect, not currently a top player, wouldn't start for our rivals\n\nOzil - Fuck knows. On a good day, he could start for anyone, on a bad day, he can be championship quality. Would start for most sides but they'd hope he turns up\n\nOx - looked much better as a CM than winger, hard to tell if he'd be top quality as a CM because he never really gets to play there.

Honestly, I'm not trying to bash Arsenal but this is the reality when you're not invested in the club as a fan.\n\nArsene Wenger has been performing miracles with that young team, and when he's gone Arsenal will have to spend more than United to stay in the top 4.\n\nYour individual players are mediocre, the team is not and it's because of Wenger.",

You always get close, but you never win...it&amp;#39;s because the manager can only take you so far. The Arsenal squad has been mediocre for nearly a decade now, and Wenger has been pushing them way past expectations for someone looking in from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides Alexis, Özil, and maybe Kos...I can&amp;#39;t think of a single player in Arsenal that would start in Bayern, Real, Barca, Juve, AM, even in domestic clubs Chelsea and City. Honestly, I&amp;#39;m not trying to bash Arsenal but this is the reality when you&amp;#39;re not invested in the club as a fan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arsene Wenger has been performing miracles with that young team, and when he&amp;#39;s gone Arsenal will have to spend more than United to stay in the top 4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your individual players are mediocre, the team is not and it&amp;#39;s because of Wenger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There has been a lot of talk about fan TV in general over the last week.

The Guardian discussed their position in the world of football media.

His comments after the Chelsea game were not out of order, he had every right to voice his opinion, and he&amp;#39;s been quite strong in backing himself up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a missed opportunity. There has been a lot of talk about fan TV in general over the last week. Football365 discussed their links to media companies (iirc allegations that AFTV, and the Chelsea, Spurs and United ones were all owned by the same company). The Guardian discussed their position in the world of football media. These were points that could have been brought up with Gary, instead of trying to win the &amp;quot;fight&amp;quot; which they had manufactured in it&amp;#39;s entirity. Very disappointing really, though I shouldn&amp;#39;t have expected anything more from AFTV. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Wenger is offered a position as 'Club Ambassador ' and a role in the front office, but he chooses to spurn the ownership's offer and instead accept a now Bilic-less West Ham's offer to be their new manager.\n\nWenger's  West Ham makes a number of savy transfers in his first two windows (including convincing an aging Zlatan to leave United after falling out of favor with United due to several nagging injuries that ended his 2016/2017campaign early), and surprises all pundits and most fans when they finish 4th in the prem. This almost breaks the Internet, as the Wenger 4th memes rage out of control prior to the next season.\n\nDuring the Summer a now physically failing Ibrahimovic realizes his skills have diminished to a level he is not comfortable with, and requests a transfer back to Ajax. Fans and pundits are outraged, yet not all that shocked, when Wenger chooses not to sign a new striker in the next window and insteasy chooses to roll with Antonio and a long  forgotten Andy Carroll.\n\nIn the 2018/2019 season, West Ham gets off to a hot start as Wenger's new talent and system have been fully engrained in the team, but another Andy Carroll injury leaves the team thin up front and without options to turn to. By February the team sits 10 points off the top of the table in 5th with 13 games left to play, and following a 2-1 home loss to Juventus in the round of 16, look to be on their way out. Pundits criticize Wenger for having the same faults for the past 15 years, but he remains adamant thay with the return of Carroll this team can challenge for titles. The Internet laugh it's collective ass off.\n\nWenger is proven corrext however, as Carroll returns, and the team goes on an unbeaten run to close out the year including a 1-0 win over his nemesis Mourinho which knocks United down to 5th on the last day of the season. This caps off one of the most remarkable seasons and comebacks ever in the Premier League. Wenger having won the league, focuses his attention on the Champions League final. Despite being unbeaten for nearly 3 months, Wenger looks down the barrels at a  Bayern Munich side that for years tormented his Arsenal. \n\nOn the day of the game, Arsenal fans far and wide choose to ignore that it's West Ham, and join up to cheer on their Manager. 'For Arsene' they say, as the game begins. Its a physical game, and Bayern dominates possession, but in the 79th minute Andy Carroll, who has just finished his first full season without injury in God knows how long, drives home a header from a corner, and West Ham hold on to win.\n\nArsenal fans, West Ham fans, English fans, French fans are all ecstatic as Wenger heads up to the stage to lift the trophy that has eluded him for so long. When asked about this underdog Hammers team he responds, \"these are my new invincibles!\" A cheeky smile comes across his face. In bars far and wide, tears roll down the cheeks of Arsenal fans.\"What do you have to say to Arsenal fans who believe their team are the only invincibles?\" The interviewer continues.\n\nArsene, a big smile across his face, reaches into his bubble jacket, and removes a pair of sunglasses. Sliding them down over his eyes he leans into the mic and cooly proclaims, \"Deal with it!\" A roar erupts from the stands and Wenger walks off and into the sunset. He retires the next day.\n\nSix years later, Arsene an old man now, hobbles to the TV at his beach house in the South of France. The Champions League music begins, and on the screen, a Diego Simone led Arsenal has just defeated a Barcelona squad playing in a champions league final for the first time without Messi.Turning it off he walks out to his chair in the sand,  and as he puts his sunglasses over his eyes, he chuckles to himself, \"Deal with it!\" \n\nNow, as the final pages in the book of Arsene Wenger's life finally pass by, he feels the warm sun on his back and hears the soft sounds of the ocean. He thinks of Arsenals return to glory, and the long journey that has been his life in football and smiles. \n\n[Cue Somewhere Over the Rainbow/Wonderful World]\n\nFin",

I have thoroughly enjoyed my experiences of watching Arsenal infinitely more under his management. On top of that I was able to enjoy the greatest team the club has ever had, and perhaps the best team the Premier League has seen (debatable of course) during his time and it gave me pleasure I've never had as a football fan during tat era. Also, he was intstrumetal in transitioning the club into what it is today, something that was by no means a given to happen without him.\n\nThen there's the rational part of me that asks if a change of manager is enough. I think Arsenal's biggest problem is that they are so woefully ill-equipped for the Post-Wenger era that it's genuinely terrifying. At times you get the sense that Wenger is the only truly football oriented person in a senior role at the club. The rest are PR and business experts. Even Ferguson had greater checks and balances. And I worry that we become more like Liverpool (i.e. in and out of the top sides) than Chelsea or City.\n\nIf we hire a great coach, for arguments sake a Simeone or someone, they're just that - coaches. We need a lot of people behind the scenes to help drive the football side beyond the training and sideline. It's a huge task. And we're not a club that has the financial muscle of united to endure too much of sustained fall without running the risk of being surpassed y our competitors.\n\nFinally, I think Wenger is perhaps just a great manager. It wouldn't shock me if he went of to Barca or somewhere ad was amazing. And it became clear that the culture of the club beyond Wenger was the bigger issue. I also worry that we'll lose our best talent (Alexis) if he were to leave, making progress even more difficult.\n\nIn the end I think him walking away might be the right thing.

It seems to me that the players of those teams are in the need of some sort of father figure to turn to. Maybe it is like that because the players don't train together on a day-to-day basis over a long period of time like they do for their clubs.\n\nHaving that theory in mind, i did some research and found the ages of coaches who won an international tournament since 2000. Here is the list (ages are those at the time of win)\n\n2000: (euro) France - Roger Lemerre - 59\n\n2002: (wc) Brazil - Luiz Felipe Scolari - 54\n\n2004: (euro) Greece - Otto Rehhagel - 66\n\n2006: (wc) Italy - Marcello Lippi - 58\n\n2008: (euro) Spain - Luis Aragonés - 70\n\n2010: (wc) Spain - Vicente del Bosque - 60\n\n2012: (euro) Spain - Vicente del Bosque - 62\n\n2014: (wc) Germany - Joachim Löw - 54\n\n2016: (euro) Portugal - Fernando Santos - 61\n\nWith Luiz Felipe Scolari and Joachim Löw being the exceptions, everybody else on the list is either close to their sixties or in their sixties, with Luis Aragonés being the only over sixty.\n\nI do not believe that age alone had to do anything with winning the tournaments, but i do believe that Arsène Wenger sitting at 67 years old should not be considered too old.\n\nJust a few thoughts",

The defenders over commit toward his feint and then he has the time and space to make his pinpoint passes he's so well known for.\n\n[Busquets has this \"gotcha\" move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH3VCGSbDt4) where he pulls back with the foot closest to the defender, but at such a sharp angle that their tackle can't reach, and then he can push off in the direction opposite their momentum.\n\n[Iniesta glides past defenders with la croqueta.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbT3m4w4AL0)\n\n[Ronaldo has his chop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nPL4swMSHk)\n\nWhat other players have a signature move?

You’ve consistently demonstrated less passion and desire than can commonly be found within the contents of a sloth’s scrotum, so frankly you can just all fuck off – don’t pass go, don’t collect your wages, don’t ever come back to this town again.\n\n&gt; I look forward to you serving me at my local McDonald’s drive-through in the near future.\n\n&gt; Yours sincerely\n\n&gt; A very disillusioned Mariner\n\n***\n\n[Censored version here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6579204/Grimsby-Town-fans-furious-letter-an-internet-hit.html).\n",

I just want them to know what they said was wrong and harmful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But seriously I&amp;#39;m 21 and in first year uni, who the hell cyber bullys anonymously at this age? Just go up to my face and call me a knob head if you don&amp;#39;t like me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: someone pathetically tried to bully me&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
