1. Where do I get the list of subreddits from?
2. How do I store previous requests, instead of overwriting all the time?
3. Where do I store all my requests?
4. How does the backend communicate to the front-end that there's new data?
5. How many request to reddit am I sending, can I schedule them in a smarter way i.e. by popularity on my site or by subscriber count.
