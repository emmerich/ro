I had done everything I had thought I was able to do one this game mode done every challenge possible, an all English XI, former glory teams, managing a European powerhouse you name it I had probably done or at least attempted it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this challenge happened by complete fluke, I had decided I would do a player career mode with ol&amp;#39; hard grafter Scott Parker at Fulham. Make a back story of doing my coaching badges and coaching the youth side. Play for one season and retire to go on and manage maybe a League One club. Everything was fine until March when I got injured, nothing serious out for around a month. But since Fulham were floundering in midtable, knocked out of the cups and Parker being 35 so more likely than not he was going to retire anyway at the end if the season, I just retired on the spot once I got the news. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The offers weren&amp;#39;t great, the likes of relegation candidates Huddersfield, Preston North End and Rotherham plus two clubs from France&amp;#39;s Ligue 2 ; Troyes and Tours. However, one offer stood out, not a popular offer quite the opposite from probably one of the most hated teams in England! Not Leeds or Millwall but MILTON KEYNES DONS! Typically on FIFA 16 they&amp;#39;re usually the favourites to get relegated  but on this occasion they were currently sat at 10th and 12 points outside the play-offs and being only March there was enough time to fight for it. I thought &amp;quot;fuck it&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;ve never been MK Dons nor would I often choose to from scratch, they&amp;#39;re punching well above their weight and it&amp;#39;s the best chance they&amp;#39;ll get for promotion! They had some experienced players the likes of Mathew Upson, Kevin Long, McFazdean, Jay Emmanuel-Thomas, Nicky Maynard and Johnny Williams. All decent but not spectacular. I set out and played a 4-4-2, direct long ball approach, putting as many passes as possible in the danger zone since technical players were lacking but the front two had great physical stats so why not use that to our advantage? We went unbeaten winning all the remainder of our games and emphasising the importance of defence. We actually did and got to the play-offs by two points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I faced the toughest challenge yet of playing top seed in the play-offs Middlesborough who were scoring for fun all season! They had double the amount of goals I had scored we narrowly beat them 1-0 after two legs. The day comes and the mighty MK Dons are in Wembley our allocation of 10 had completely sold out and we&amp;#39;re up against the giants of Sheffield Wednesday. We breeze past them and comfortably beat them 2-0 a brace from Maynard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after reading up on Neil Warnock who is a specialist in promotions, I came across a Portuguese fella (completely forgot his name) who had won promotion like 9 times to the Portuguese Primera Division! Which got me thinking! Why dont I do that with Scotty P? Carve out a niche for myself where teams are desperate to earn some that TV monay! And is something I haven&amp;#39;t done at all in FIFA and have yet to find something similar on this sub. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was thinking again who in the right mind wants to manage a franchise in the Premier League? Not Scotty P that&amp;#39;s for sure! So I quit in the summer of 2017 and joined Bolton Wanderers who had an amazing squad full of young promising players as well as experience so the task in hand was pretty straight forward, probably the easiest team I&amp;#39;ve had to deal with, I didn&amp;#39;t need to buy anyone just play really. We achieved a comfortable 2nd place finish and guess what?
